# Product-pricing-using-html-csss
 This project is about a product pricing system.
 1. HTML structure:
        * The <html>, <head>, and <body> tags are included in the HTML document, which begins with the standard 
           <!DOCTYPEhtml> declaration.
        * The document's metadata, including the page title, viewport settings, and character set, are contained in the 
            <head> element.
        * To improve the typography, a link to Google Fonts' 'Baloo 2' font is included to the <head>.
 2. CSS Styling:
         a. CSS is used for overall styling, which defines the page's appearance.
         b. The body element provides a visually beautiful gradient backdrop using linear-gradient and sets the default 
             font- family, margin, and padding.
         c. The header element applies a transparent backdrop, white color, and a larger font size to the heading at the top 
            of the page. 'Baloo 2' typeface is used for a fashionable appearance.
         d. The pricing cards on the page are aligned and centered horizontally by the pricing-container class, a type of 
            flex container.
 3. Pricing containers:
         a. A pricing-card class represents each pricing choice.
            To make the cards look like cards, they contain padding, box shadow, border, and border-radius.
         b. When a user hovers over a card, a slight translation is applied using the :hover pseudo-class.
         c. The h2 element contains the plan's name, while the p element offers a brief explanation of the plan.
             The cost of the plan is shown in the price class with a bolder text size and weight.
         d. The "Sign Up" button has the btn class added to it, which changes the background color when the button is 
            hovered over, making it look attractive.
